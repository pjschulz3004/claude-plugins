# Dialogue Craft

Every line of dialogue is an action: a character using words to get something from someone.

## Subtext: The Three Layers

1. **Text**: The words spoken
2. **Subtext**: What the character actually means/wants
3. **Context**: What the reader understands (may exceed both characters' awareness)

When text and subtext align, the scene is "on the nose" and dramatically dead.
The gap between strategy (text) and want (subtext) is where tension lives.

### Seven Subtext Techniques

1. **Contradiction**: Words say one thing, body does another. "I'm fine." She tore the napkin into strips. The reader believes the body.
2. **Deflection**: Character talks about something else (weather, food, logistics) while the real subject throbs underneath. The displacement should be metaphorically adjacent, not random.
3. **Answering a different question**: Every redirect is a confession about what they're actually thinking about. "Did you love him?" / "He made coffee in a way I've never been able to replicate."
4. **Overly formal speech**: Register mismatch as emotional armor. Suddenly precise language signals the speaker is holding something at distance.
5. **The unsaid reply**: Silence as answer. A character who doesn't respond to a question has answered it. Non-response is the loudest response.
6. **Over-explanation**: Talking too much, too fast, too insistently about something trivial. The volume is the tell. What they won't shut up about is what they can't face.
7. **Pinter pause**: Three levels of silence. Ellipsis (...) = hesitation. Pause = minor crisis, recalibration. Silence = major crisis, the ground has shifted.

## Power Dynamics (Johnstone)

Every line is a status move. Characters constantly raise/lower their own or others' status. No neutral speech exists.

### High-Status Markers
- Still head, sustained eye contact, slow movement
- Finishing others' sentences, comfortable silence
- Taking up physical space, touching others' possessions
- Short declarative statements, no hedging
- Using first names when others use titles

### Low-Status Markers
- Rapid head movement, breaking eye contact first
- Laughing at own jokes, over-explaining, excessive nodding
- Occupying less space, fidgeting, self-touching (neck, face)
- Hedging, qualifiers, trailing sentences, apologizing

### Status Transactions in Practice
- **Who speaks first?** Less power often initiates
- **Who controls topic?** Power = ability to redirect
- **Who interrupts?** Interruption is a status claim
- **Who gets the last word?** Closure is dominance
- **Address patterns**: Names, titles, nicknames all encode status
- **The status flip**: The scene's most dramatic moment. The subordinate gains leverage (information, moral authority, a skill the dominant lacks)

Assign each character a status number (1-10) entering and exiting every scene. If the numbers don't change, the scene may be static.

## Oblique Response (Stein)

"Directness diminishes, obliqueness sings." Characters rarely answer directly.

**Response types**:
- **Deflection**: Answering with a topic change
- **Counter-question**: Responding to a question with a question
- **Non-sequitur**: Apparent irrelevance that carries emotional logic
- **Partial answer**: Giving 30% of the truth, implying the rest
- **Silence**: The most powerful oblique response

Direct answers kill momentum. Oblique answers create it.

## Dialogue as Action (Mamet)

Three questions for every scene: **Who wants what? What happens if they don't get it? Why now?**

Every line pursues an objective. Characters use words as tools: to persuade, intimidate, seduce, dismiss, test, wound. If you can write the scene as a silent movie and the power dynamics still read, the foundation is right. Dialogue layers on top.

"To say something is to do something." Characters speak from want, not from knowledge. When dialogue feels like exposition, the speaker has no motive beyond informing the reader.

## Voice Differentiation

### Six Axes
1. **Vocabulary**: Education, class, profession, region, generation encoded in word choice
2. **Sentence structure**: Short declaratives (control), long recursive (complexity/anxiety), fragments (intensity), trailing (uncertainty)
3. **Rhythm**: Staccato bursts vs. flowing periods. Rhythm is identity
4. **Verbal tics**: 1-2 per character, at emotionally significant moments. "Look..." (defensive), "I mean..." (self-correcting), "sorry" (space-shrinking)
5. **Topics**: What they gravitate toward, what they avoid. Avoidance patterns map interior wounds
6. **Formality/register**: How they shift between contexts. Code-switching reveals social intelligence; rigidity reveals character

### The Radio Test
Cover all tags and beats. Can you identify each speaker from words alone? If any character's lines are interchangeable, voice differentiation has failed.

### Speech Under Pressure
Characters under stress don't become more articulate. They regress: simpler words, childhood patterns, repetition. A sophisticated speaker reduced to "Stop. Just stop." reveals more than eloquence.

## Tag Craft

**"Said" for 90%+**: Invisible to readers. The brain processes it as punctuation. "Asked" and "replied" are acceptable alternates. Everything else ("exclaimed," "intoned," "opined") draws attention away from the dialogue.

**Action beats over adverbs**: Not "she said angrily" but a physical action: "She stabbed at her salad." The action must be specific, not generic. "Crossed his arms" tells nothing. "Stacking papers, aligning each edge with his thumbnail" tells everything.

**Beat placement**:
- Before dialogue = setup (grounds the speaker before they speak)
- After dialogue = dimension (adds layer the words didn't carry)
- Interrupting dialogue = tension/pause (forces the reader to wait)

**When to cut tags entirely**: In two-person exchanges with distinct voices, run 5-8 lines unattributed. Drop a beat every 4-6 lines to reorient. In group scenes, attribute more frequently.

## Information Control

**What characters know vs. reveal**: Every character in a scene has a private information state. Map it before writing. The gaps between characters' knowledge create every form of tension.

- **Dramatic irony** (reader knows more than character): Every mundane line becomes loaded. The reader winces at the character's ignorance.
- **Mystery** (reader knows less than character): Withholding creates pull. The reader reads forward to close the gap.
- **Strategic withholding** (character knows but won't say): Silence as power. Information is currency. Characters spend it tactically.
- **Information as weapon**: Deploying a fact to wound. "Your father would have known what to do." Delivers information AND attacks.

Never have characters explain what both already know (As-You-Know-Bob). Deliver exposition through argument, contradiction, information under duress, or oblique reference.

## DFW Dialogue Techniques

- **Recursive self-correction**: Characters who qualify their qualifications, circle meaning through spiraling clauses. The hedging IS the characterization.
- **Parenthetical interjection**: Mid-sentence asides that reveal the speaker's self-awareness, adding layers without breaking the sentence's trajectory.
- **Intellectual hedging as character**: "Which is to say..." and "I mean..." signal a mind that processes in real time, refining thought as it speaks.
- **The verbal essay**: Characters who theorize aloud, building arguments mid-conversation. The theory must serve the dramatic moment, not lecture.
- **Sincerity despite self-awareness**: The DFW paradox: knowing you're performing sincerity doesn't make the sincerity false. Characters who are aware of their own verbal patterns and comment on them.

## Argument Architecture

### Structure of Escalation
1. **Surface trigger**: Something small sparks it. Dirty dishes. A tone. Never the real issue.
2. **Escalation**: Each response raises stakes. Past grievances deploy. Lines shorten and sharpen.
3. **The turn**: One character says the unsayable. Quiet, precise, devastating. This line changes the relationship permanently.
4. **Aftermath**: Silence, departure, collapse. No neat resolution. Damage radiates into subsequent scenes.

### Techniques
- **Upping pattern**: Each line matches and raises. "You forgot." / "I was busy." / "You're always busy."
- **Regression under pressure**: Characters lose articulation as emotions intensify. Fragments, repetition, simpler vocabulary.
- **The third rail**: Every relationship has topics too dangerous to touch. The argument eventually touches one.
- **Both characters must be partially right**: If one is entirely wrong, it's a lecture, not a fight. The reader's discomfort comes from valid perspectives in collision.

## Group Conversations (3+ Speakers)

- **Subgroup and stage**: Not everyone speaks simultaneously. Create foreground/background layers. Establish physical positions early.
- **Anchor speaker**: One character drives, others react. The anchor's goal is the scene's spine.
- **Strategic silence**: The quiet character is often the most interesting. Why are they silent?
- **Differentiated roles**: Each speaker brings a different mode: one drives, one deflects with humor, one asks hard questions, one watches. If two characters serve the same function, one is redundant.
- **Attribution discipline**: Group scenes need more attribution, not less. Use action beats to ground each speaker in physical space.
- **Hidden hierarchy**: Map who controls the room before writing. It determines who speaks first, who gets interrupted, who gets the last word.

## Dialogue Checklist

- [ ] Every line pursues an objective (not just conveying information)
- [ ] Subtext layer exists beneath the surface dialogue
- [ ] Power dynamic shifts at least once during the scene
- [ ] Each speaker passes the Radio Test (identifiable without tags)
- [ ] Tags are invisible ("said" 90%+, no adverbs, no said-bookisms)
- [ ] Action beats are specific and characterizing, not generic
- [ ] No As-You-Know-Bob exposition
- [ ] At least one moment of silence, deflection, or oblique response
- [ ] Argument scenes escalate through turns, not parallel monologues
- [ ] Characters under pressure lose articulation (regression, not eloquence)
- [ ] Scene opens with friction, closes on a hinge
- [ ] Read aloud: every line sounds spoken, never written

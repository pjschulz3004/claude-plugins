# Character Voices

Techniques for distinctive characterization and voice differentiation.

## The STEAL Method (Indirect Characterization)

Reveal character through five channels:

### S — Speech
Word choice reveals education, background, class. Sentence structure reveals thought patterns.
What they DON'T say reveals as much as what they do. Verbal tics become signatures.

### T — Thoughts
Show the gap between think and say. Reveal private judgments, rationalizations, self-deceptions.
Let contradictions exist. Characters are hypocrites.

### E — Effect on Others
Others' reactions reveal what we can't see from inside.
Body language shifts when certain characters enter. Reputation precedes.

### A — Actions
Actions under pressure reveal true character. Small choices accumulate into identity.
The gap between stated values and actual behavior IS characterization.

### L — Looks
Chosen appearance vs. what they're stuck with. How they carry themselves.
Involuntary physical tells. How appearance changes under stress.

## Building Distinctive Voices

### The Radio Test
Cover the dialogue tags. Can you tell who's speaking?
Each character needs 3-5 distinctive markers.

### Voice Differentiation Axes
1. **Vocabulary**: Education level, profession, region, class
2. **Sentence structure**: Complete vs. fragments, simple vs. complex
3. **Rhythm**: Terse vs. verbose, fast vs. deliberate
4. **Verbal tics**: Repeated words, hedges, interjections
5. **Topics**: What they gravitate toward, obsessions, avoidances
6. **Formality**: How it shifts based on audience and stress

### Speech Under Pressure
Stress reveals the real person. Characters should sound different when:
- Comfortable (longer sentences, humor, shorthand)
- Nervous (hedging, trailing off, over-explaining)
- Angry (shorter, more direct, verbal tics amplify)
- Lying (too much detail, overly formal, topic avoidance)

### Subtext Patterns
What characters typically mean when they say certain things.
Create a says/means table for each major character.

## Voice Through Narration

In first-person or close-third POV, narration IS character voice.

### Infuse Observations with Character
Not: "The room was dirty."
But: "The room had the kind of dirt that accumulates when nobody's been paid enough to care."

### Let the Narrator Have Opinions
POV characters judge, analyze, have preferences and prejudices. Let them show.

### Use the Character's Knowledge Base
A tactician thinks in strategic terms. A musician thinks in rhythm and harmony.
An organizer thinks in systems and leverage. Metaphors come from their world.

## Character Consistency & Contradiction

### Consistent Core
Core values, behavioral patterns, speech patterns, fundamental motivations persist.

### Surface Contradictions
Humans are hypocrites. Stated beliefs don't always match behavior.
Characters can surprise themselves. Growth means old patterns breaking.
This isn't an error. It's characterization.

## The Iceberg Principle
Only 10% of character should be visible on the page.
On page: actions, dialogue, key physical details, decisive moments.
Below surface: full backstory, complete motivation, every thought, exhaustive description.
Trust the reader. Show a flinch; don't explain the abuse.

## Show vs. Tell Balance
Show: emotional moments, character-defining choices, relationship dynamics, internal conflict.
Tell: establishing facts quickly, transitions, information readers need but can't be demonstrated.
Rule: Show the important stuff. Tell the scaffolding.

## Character Profile Template

For each character, define:
- **Core identity**: One-sentence essence
- **Wound/Need/Want/Fear**: Psychological foundation
- **Speech patterns**: Vocabulary, structure, rhythm, formality
- **Verbal tics**: 3-5 distinctive markers
- **Subtext patterns**: Says X / Means Y table
- **Physical tells**: Body language by emotional state
- **Knowledge base**: What they notice and how they describe it
- **Arc trajectory**: Where they start → key turns → where they end

## Interlude/Multiple POV Rules

When writing from non-protagonist POV:
- **Limited omniscience**: Only what this character knows, sees, thinks
- **Character filter**: All descriptions reflect this character's personality
- **No head-hopping**: Stay locked in one consciousness per scene
- **Knowledge boundaries**: Before every fact, verify: Can they know this? Would they notice? How would they interpret it?
- **Free indirect discourse**: Blend character voice into narration without constant thought tags

## Dialogue Functions

Every dialogue line must accomplish at least one:
1. Reveal character (how they speak)
2. Advance plot (move story forward)
3. Create/release tension (conflict or resolution)
4. Provide information (exposition, done carefully)
5. Establish relationship (power dynamics, history)

If a line does none: cut it.

## First-Person Specific Craft

### Temporal Distance
The gap between the narrating self and the experiencing self. Choose and be consistent:
- **Immediate**: Narrator tells it as it happens. Present tense or very close past. Raw, unreflective.
- **Recent past**: Narrator knows how the scene ends but not the arc. Can foreshadow subtly.
- **Distant retrospective**: Narrator knows everything. Can comment with irony. Risk: why tell it at all?

### Retrospective Irony
The narrator knows more than their past self did. Use this gap:
- Dramatic irony: "I thought that was the worst it could get." (Reader knows it wasn't.)
- Self-commentary: "I told myself I was being strategic. I was being afraid."
- Warning signals: "I should have noticed the way she paused before answering."

Control the dosage. Too much retrospective commentary breaks immersion in the present action.

### Narrative Reliability
Every first-person narrator is unreliable. The question is how and about what:
- **Self-perception gaps**: What the narrator claims about themselves vs. what their actions show
- **Blind spots**: What they consistently fail to notice (reveals character)
- **Motivated reasoning**: Where their analysis serves their ego rather than truth
- **Competence variance**: Smart narrators can still be emotionally stupid

### The Intellectual Narrator Trap
Smart narrators (like Taylor) risk: turning every scene into analysis, crowding out feeling with theory, making the narrator more interesting than the story. Fix: force situations where analysis fails. Make the body betray the brain. Let other characters be right when the narrator is wrong.

## Multi-POV Balance

### Screen Time Allocation
- Primary POV gets 60-70% of total wordcount
- Secondary POVs share the remainder based on arc importance
- Track cumulative wordcount per POV across arcs to prevent drift
- Every POV chapter must advance that character's arc (not just provide information)

### The Ensemble Gravity Problem
Primary POV characters attract narrative attention. Supporting characters drift into orbit.
Fix: Give every POV character a scene where they're the most interesting person in the room.
Give every supporting character at least one moment where they know something the protagonist doesn't.

### POV Transition Craft
- End one POV chapter on a question. Start the next on a different question (not an answer)
- Voice shift must be immediate: first sentence should sound different
- Never use POV switches to create cheap cliffhangers without payoff

## Voice Quick Checks
- [ ] Each character passes the Radio Test (identifiable without tags)
- [ ] Vocabulary matches background and education
- [ ] Verbal tics present but not overdone
- [ ] Subtext exists (what's NOT said matters)
- [ ] Speech changes based on audience and stress level
- [ ] Narration infused with POV character's perspective
- [ ] Actions under pressure reveal true character
- [ ] Consistent core with surface contradictions
- [ ] First-person: temporal distance consistent, reliability gaps intentional
- [ ] Multi-POV: voices immediately distinguishable, screen time balanced

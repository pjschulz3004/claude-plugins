# Character Craft Reference

Arc design, ensemble management, and first-person POV craft for character planning and structural editing.

## The Lie/Truth Paradigm

Every arc revolves around a **Lie** the character believes and a **Truth** the story argues. The Lie is a specific, articulable proposition ("The only way to survive is alone," "Power means control"). The Truth is the counter-argument. The story is the trial.

**Want vs. Need**: The Want is the external goal driven by the Lie. The Need is the internal change required (connected to the Truth). When Want and Need conflict, drama lives in the gap. The Want drives plot; the Need drives theme.

The Lie must be **sympathetic**. The reader must understand why the character believes it. A Lie born from real pain earns reader investment. A Lie born from stupidity earns contempt.

## The Ghost/Wound Chain

**Ghost** (specific past event) > **Wound** (psychological damage) > **Lie** (false belief adopted to cope) > **Want** (misguided external pursuit) > **Flaw** (behavioral pattern in daily life) > **Need** (the Truth that resolves it)

Every major decision traces back to the Wound. Scale the Ghost to the arc: bigger Ghost justifies bigger Lie justifies longer arc. Reveal the Ghost **progressively** (not all at once). Each revelation adds sympathy and reframes prior behavior. Full picture arrives around Midpoint or Third Plot Point.

## Five Arc Types

| Type | Start | End | Engine |
|------|-------|-----|--------|
| **Positive Change** | Lie | Positive Truth | Character dismantles the Lie, embraces Truth at cost |
| **Flat/Testing** | Truth | Truth (held) | Character's conviction transforms the world around them |
| **Disillusionment** | Comforting Lie | Bitter Truth | Truth is real but provides no comfort. Wiser but wounded |
| **Fall** | Lie | Worse Lie | Character encounters Truth, rejects it, doubles down. Tragedy is in the refusal |
| **Corruption** | Truth | Lie | Character abandons Truth for power/safety/desire. Incremental compromise |

**Flat arcs** carry tension through endurance: the world punishes the character for holding Truth. Best for stories about systemic change and collective action.

**Fall arcs** require the reader to see the off-ramp the character drives past. The choice must be visible.

**Corruption arcs** work through incremental moral compromise. No single step feels like villainy; the aggregate is monstrous.

## Structural Beats (Positive Change Arc)

| Beat | ~Timing | Function |
|------|---------|----------|
| Hook | 1% | Character operates within the Lie (it functions, barely) |
| Inciting Event | 12% | First hint the Lie will not hold |
| First Plot Point | 25% | Forced from comfort zone; old strategies fail |
| First Pinch | 37% | Punished for relying on the Lie |
| **Midpoint** | **50%** | **Encounters the Truth directly but cannot yet abandon the Lie** |
| Second Pinch | 62% | Rewarded for using Truth; begins to see its power |
| Third Plot Point | 75% | Low moment; Lie fully confronted and rejected |
| Climax | 88% | Consciously wields Truth against central conflict |
| Resolution | 100% | New world shaped by the Truth |

The **Midpoint** is the pivot: character shifts from reactive (clinging to Lie) to active (testing Truth). Before: buffeted by events. After: beginning to choose.

## The Crisis Decision

The binary choice where the character must choose between Lie and Truth under maximum pressure. Design this **FIRST**, then work backward. Everything builds to this moment.

**What makes it work:**
- It must **cost** something. Easy choices are not crises
- Both options must be **viable**. The Lie must be tempting, not just wrong
- The character's specific **Wound** must be at stake
- The character must **choose**, not be forced. Agency is essential
- Two halves: internal decision (private, wordless) then external proof (public action)

**Two crisis types:** Prioritization (choose between competing values) and Irreconcilable Goods (two genuinely positive options that cannot coexist). The second is more powerful because there is no "right answer."

## Multi-Arc Pacing

In long-form fiction, a single Lie-to-Truth arc rarely sustains across hundreds of thousands of words. Use **sequential arcs**: each installment examines the core need from a new angle.

- Each arc needs its own internal Lie/Truth cycle while contributing to the macro-arc
- Not every arc needs a full crisis. Sub-arcs and partial breakthroughs are valid
- **Regression** is earned when: triggered by new pressure echoing the Wound, proportional to growth stage, costly (not a reset), and revealing a new layer (not a photocopy)
- Arc type can shift across arcs (Positive > Flat > Corruption)
- The character who ends an arc should be measurably different but recognizably incomplete

**Repetition is the primary risk.** Each regression must go somewhere new. If the character rehearses the same doubt without visible progress, the arc feels stalled.

## Ensemble Cognitive Limits

- **3-5 main characters**: manageable with deep development
- **4-6 POV characters**: the sweet spot
- **4-5 characters per scene**: upper limit before readers lose track
- **6-11 subplot threads**: typical range in published novels

Confusion comes from **similar** characters, not many characters. Differentiate through voice, physicality, attitude, and narrative role. If two characters serve the same function, merge them.

**Cast lifecycle:** Introduce (staggered, 2-3 at a time) > Develop (rotate focus so only a subset is active) > Peak (their arc's crisis) > Recede/Exit (sabbatical, death, departure). Track active roster at all times.

**The gravity problem:** The larger the cast, the harder the protagonist pulls focus. Give supporting characters independent relationships with each other (web, not hub-and-spoke). Every pair in the ensemble should have its own dynamic.

## Foils, Mirrors, and Parallels

**Foil:** Opposite values to protagonist. Tests protagonist's logic. Reader asks: "What if the protagonist is wrong?" Operates within the same goal structure but challenges ethics or strategy.

**Mirror:** Same wound or goal as protagonist, diverges at point of choice. Intensifies arc by showing what could have been. Reader asks: "What if the protagonist becomes this?"

**Parallel:** Structural echo. Different characters undergo similar arcs simultaneously, arriving at different conclusions. Most powerful way to explore theme from multiple angles.

**Design principle:** Each major supporting character should have their own relationship to the central Lie/Truth. They might believe the same Lie, a different Lie, the Truth, or a corrupted version of the Truth. Stagger their arc resolutions to maintain momentum. At least one character should represent the road not taken.

## First-Person Traps

**The intellectual narrator problem.** Analysis replaces feeling. The narrator who can articulate their own psychology with perfect clarity has no arc left to discover. Keep the narrator wrong about themselves. Let them analyze everything except the thing that matters.

**Information control.** The narrator can only know what they witness. Before every fact, verify: can they know this? Would they notice? How would they interpret it? Knowledge gaps generate suspense. Omniscient slips break the contract.

**Retrospective irony.** Past-tense narration creates two selves: the experiencing self and the narrating self. The tension between them can be the story's engine (what the narrator now understands vs. what they understood then). But over-editorializing ("I should have known") kills it.

**The performance trap.** First-person narrators curate their self-presentation. This is realistic (people do it), but the author must be aware it is happening. Authentic emotion requires vulnerability: admitting unflattering truths, showing the gap between speech and thought, resisting neat emotional resolution.

**Solipsism.** The narrator's consciousness becomes a closed loop. Fix: make them curious about others, ground interiority in physical sensation, give them a task, let other characters challenge their self-image.

**Voice fatigue.** In long-form, evolve the voice as the character develops. Vary the cognitive demands. The narrator must be internally complex enough to sustain interest across the full work.

## Character Arc Checklist

- [ ] **Lie** stated in one sentence. Specific proposition, not vague insecurity
- [ ] **Truth** stated as counter-argument. Lie and Truth are directly opposed
- [ ] **Ghost** is proportional to the Lie. Specific event, not vague backstory
- [ ] **Wound > Lie > Want > Flaw** chain is traceable. Every major decision connects
- [ ] **Arc type** chosen deliberately. Serves the thematic argument
- [ ] **Crisis Decision** designed first, story built backward. Costs something real
- [ ] **Midpoint** is the pivot from reactive to active (or the hinge of refusal)
- [ ] **Both Lie and Truth** present in the character from the start. Arc shifts the balance, not the identity
- [ ] **Supporting cast** mapped to Lie/Truth axis. Foils, mirrors, roads not taken
- [ ] **Regression** (if used) reveals new layers, not old patterns
- [ ] **Multi-arc pacing** distributes growth across installments. Each arc has its own cycle
- [ ] **Ensemble differentiation** passes the Radio Test. Voice, physicality, attitude, role
- [ ] **Active roster** tracked per scene/chapter. No more than 4-5 characters onstage at once
- [ ] **First-person filter** verified. Only reports what narrator could know, notice, interpret
- [ ] **Internal/external arcs** integrated. Removing the inner journey would change the plot

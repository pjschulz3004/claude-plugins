# Prose Rules

Core prose craft rules for fiction writing. Covers rhythm, imagery, voice, and line-level quality.

## Rhythm & Variance

### Spiral + Jab Pattern
Long recursive sentence ending in insight → follow with 1-clause punch.
> "The liability clause was buried in subsection 7.3, nested under three layers of cross-reference that assumed you'd already internalized the definitions from the preamble." He hadn't.

### Job-Mix Heuristic
Never run >2 sentences of the same type in a row. Sentence types:
- **Sensory** (sound/texture/temperature)
- **Observation** (body language, tells)
- **Action** (choices, movements)
- **Thought** (inference/judgment)
- **Analogy/Aside** (figurative burst, parenthetical)
- **Fact/Grounding** (theory, mechanics, rules)
- **Dialogue** (spoken line that turns the beat)
- **Orientation** (time/place shift)
- **Micro-tension** (complicate, reverse, corner)

### Rhythm Checkpoints
- Every 120-180 words: insert Action or Micro-tension move
- Every 300-500 words: ground with Fact or fresh concrete detail
- After any 30+ word spiral: follow with short jab
- Use paragraph breaks as breath resets

### Sentence Length Variance
Long sentences for: building tension, complex thought, stream of consciousness.
Short sentences for: impact, action, emphasis, turning points.
Test: Read aloud. If every sentence takes the same breath, it's too uniform.

### Paragraph Shape
Vary where the key information lands. Don't repeat the same shape:
- Opening emphasis vs. closing emphasis
- Short paragraphs vs. long
- Single-sentence paragraphs for impact (use sparingly)

## Figurative Language

### Density Control
Max 1 simile/metaphor per paragraph, placed on a turning point.
Convert extras to concrete action or direct statement.

### The 3-Question Test (every comparison must pass)
1. **Fit**: Could the subject literally do the verb in the image domain?
2. **Map**: Is source→target mapping coherent? No mixed vehicles.
3. **Use**: Does it land on a beat turn (reveal/reversal/escalation)?

If any question fails: cut or recast.

### Image Field Management
Keep 2-3 motifs max per scene. Echo within scene but never recycle exact motif in next scene.
Track already-used images to avoid repetition across chapters.

## Sensory Details

### Rotation Rule
Don't default to visual. Rotate: sight → sound → touch → smell → taste.
Smell: max 1 per scene unless plot-critical. Never pair smell with metaphor in same sentence.

### Specificity
Generic: "It smelled bad." Specific: "The alley reeked of rotting fish and diesel."
Ground sensory details in the story's world. Use locale-specific palette.

## Deep POV & Immersion

### Cut Filter Words
Remove: saw, noticed, observed, heard, felt, sensed, realized, wondered, seemed.
Before (filtered): "She saw the door swing open. She felt her heart race."
After (direct): "The door swung open. Her heart raced."

### Cut Thought Tags
In deep POV, we're already in the character's head.
Before: "She thought he was probably lying." After: "He was probably lying."

### Infused Subjectivity
Make "objective" description carry the POV character's perspective.
Neutral: "The man had a beard." Infused: "The man had one of those beards that probably took more maintenance than he'd ever admit."

### Interior/Exterior Balance
Neither should dominate for more than a page.
Intercutting: action beat, thought beat, action beat, thought beat.

## Psychic Distance (John Gardner)
Vary closeness to character's consciousness within scenes:
- Pull back for establishing shots and transitions
- Push close for emotional moments and action
- The more important the moment, the closer you should be

## Concrete:Abstract Ratio
Target: 2+ concrete nouns/props per abstract term on each page.
When theory/ideology appears, it must solve the present dramatic moment (not lecture).
Tie abstractions to immediate stakes and physical props.

## The DFW-Influenced Toolkit

### Parenthetical Asides
Thoughts within thoughts. The mind commenting on itself.
Use for: self-aware qualification, recursive observation, humor.
Warning: potent but exhausting in large doses.

### Digressions That Earn Their Keep
Every tangent must: reveal character, illuminate the subject from a new angle,
be interesting in itself, and return to the main thread.

### Sincerity Over Irony
Pure irony distances. Pure sincerity risks naivete.
Best: earnest engagement despite awareness. The contradiction IS the character.

### Maximalism = Precision, Not Padding
Go deep on one detail rather than skimming across many.
Exhaustive specificity, not more words.

## Voice Calibration

### Voice as Character
Narration should sound like a specific mind thinking.
Every observation filtered through character's knowledge, biases, and concerns.

### What Characters Notice
A character's observations reveal who they are. A tactician notices exits.
A social operator notices power dynamics. A mechanic notices machinery.

### Humor
Observational, character-driven. Never slapstick.
Best when it emerges from situation, not from setup/punchline construction.

## Lexical Repetition Pass
No descriptive word >3x per 1000 words unless deliberate motif.
Watch: "just", "still", "particular", "the kind of", any character-specific tic words.

## House Style Checklist
- [ ] Rhythm varies (spiral→jab, mixed sentence types)
- [ ] Max 1 figurative per paragraph, placed on turns, passes 3-question test
- [ ] Sensory details rotated, locale-specific
- [ ] Filter words cut
- [ ] Concrete:abstract ratio ≥ 2:1
- [ ] Lexical repetition within limits
- [ ] Voice calibrated to POV character
- [ ] Psychic distance appropriate to moment

# Story-Level Craft Reference

Dense reference for story/arc planning, structural editing, and long-form architecture.

## Framework Comparison

| Framework | Key Beats | Best For |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **3-Act** | Inciting incident (12%), PP1 (25%), Midpoint (50%), PP2 (75%), Climax (85%) | Commercial fiction, general plotting |
| **5-Act / Freytag** | Exposition, Rising, Climax *at center*, Falling, Catastrophe | Tragedy, consequence-driven stories (climax is middle, not end) |
| **Save the Cat** | 15 beats: Opening Image through Final Image. Catalyst (10%), Break into 2 (20%), Midpoint (50%), All Is Lost (75%), Break into 3 (80%) | Genre fiction, tight pacing, transformation arcs |
| **Story Circle** | 8 steps: You, Need, Go, Search, Find, Take, Return, Change. Top = order, bottom = chaos | Serial arcs, TV episodes, repeatable cycles |
| **Truby 22** | Weakness/Need, Desire, Opponent, Plan, Drive, Apparent Defeat, Self-Revelation, Moral Decision | Complex character-driven stories, interwoven subplots |
| **Hero's Journey** | Ordinary World, Call, Threshold, Ordeal, Reward, Resurrection, Return with Elixir | Epic/adventure, mythic transformation |
| **Kishotenketsu** | Ki (intro), Sho (develop), Ten (twist/recontextualize), Ketsu (reconcile) | Vignettes, interludes, scenes without conflict, thematic twists |

**Universal truths across all frameworks**: Equilibrium disrupted. Stakes escalate. Crisis forces choice. Choice reveals character. New equilibrium forms.

## Setup/Payoff Architecture

### Seven Foreshadowing Types
1. **Object**: A prop introduced early, fired later (Chekhov's gun)
2. **Dialogue**: Throwaway line whose significance emerges later
3. **Behavioral**: Small habits/choices predicting larger decisions
4. **Imagery/Symbolic**: Recurring images that accrue meaning (storms, cracks, birds)
5. **Structural**: Scene or sequence pattern that repeats with variation (ring composition)
6. **Thematic**: World rules or character dynamics that foreshadow the moral argument's resolution
7. **Red herring**: Organic misdirection with its own subplot value; resolves into coherent meaning, not nothing

### Plant Density
- **Short fiction** (<12K): 2 plants per major payoff
- **Long fiction** (30K+): 3-4 plants per major payoff
- Use the **Three-Context Rule**: First mention (register), second (pattern), third (expectation ready to fulfill or subvert)
- Each mention in a *different* context serving a *different* apparent purpose
- Best practice: write the payoff first, reverse-engineer plants

### Ring Composition
ABCBA structure where second half mirrors first in reverse. The mirrored element transforms because the character has transformed. Opening/closing bookends are the simplest form. Series-level: each volume is a beat in the chiastic structure. Contrast over repetition.

### Fair Play Principle
- Reader must have access to all information needed to understand the payoff
- **Two-read test**: First read surprises. Second read feels inevitable. If second read reveals no foreshadowing, you cheated
- The contract: What I show you matters. What matters, I show you. Rules I establish, I follow. Questions I raise, I answer

## Thematic Architecture

### Controlling Idea (McKee)
Formula: **[Value] is [achieved/lost] because [cause].**
Three types: Idealistic (up-ending), Pessimistic (down-ending), Ironic (up/down, most complex).
The story's events ARE the argument. If your climax contradicts your intended theme, the climax wins.

### Four-Corner Opposition (Truby)
At least four characters each embody a different answer to the same moral problem. Not binary debate but multi-sided argument. Every major character is a variation on the theme. Plot tests all answers simultaneously.

### Le Guin Test
Can a character argue the opposite of your theme convincingly? If not, you don't understand your own theme. No strawmen. The opposition must have genuine intelligence, genuine grievances.

### Theme as Question
Chekhov: "The correct formulation of the problem is required of the artist, not the solution." Frame the question so precisely the reader cannot ignore it. Then step back. The reader is the jury.

### Integration Checklist
- Theme emerges from character choice under pressure, not narration
- Lie/Truth engine: Want (symptoms) vs. Need (transformation)
- Each subplot illuminates the main theme from a different angle
- 2-3 motifs per story, varied in context, escalating in weight
- Controlling metaphor: one metaphoric frame the whole story reads through
- Show OR tell the theme. Never both. Never preach

## Serial Fractal Structure

### Same Shape at Every Scale
| Level | Contains | Must Have |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Scene | Beats | Goal, complication, disaster/turn |
| Chapter | 1-5 scenes | Opening friction, at least one turn, closing hook/hinge |
| Arc | Multiple chapters | Own inciting incident, midpoint shift, climax, resolution |
| Series | Multiple arcs | Global promise, midpoint reversal, climactic confrontation |

Each chapter mirrors arc structure. Each arc mirrors story structure. Fractal coherence means every page delivers structural satisfaction.

### Sawtooth Pacing
Tension rises within arc, partially releases between arcs, overall trend upward. Valleys never return to baseline. Each arc's peak exceeds the previous. Each trough is higher than the last. The corridor of calm narrows as the series progresses.

Within a chapter: at least 1 turn per ~300 words. Within an arc: escalation to crisis, then breathing room that seeds the next arc. Rotate scene types (action, dialogue, introspection, planning, relationship, exploration). Never >2 consecutive same-type scenes.

### Promise Management
Every chapter must accomplish 2 of 3: advance plot, develop character, deliver satisfaction.
Chapter endings: 60-70% high-tension hooks, 20-30% medium hooks, 10-20% breathing room.
Arc endings: resolve the arc's central question but open a new one. Resolution-problem linkage.

## Stakes Hierarchy

| Level | What's Threatened | Emotional Power |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Identity** | Who the character IS (beliefs, integrity, self-concept) | Highest |
| **Relationship** | Who they might lose or gain (trust, love, community) | Very high |
| **Survival** | Whether they live or die | High |
| **Community** | Whether their group survives | Medium-high |
| **World** | Whether civilization continues | Medium (requires personal anchor) |

**Key principles**:
- Betraying principles to survive can devastate more than dying with them intact
- Global stakes work only when embodied in personal stakes (Tolkien: the Shire, not "Middle-earth")
- Escalate complexity over magnitude: harder problems, not bigger explosions
- Progress personal to institutional: immediate circle (early arcs) to community to systems (late arcs)
- Every escalation must carry costs: strain, collateral, lost relationships, moral compromise

## Emotional Impact

### Vonnegut's Six Story Shapes (Applied to Arcs)
1. **Rags to riches** (steady rise): Early arcs, building momentum
2. **Tragedy** (steady fall): Villain arcs, cautionary subplots
3. **Man in a hole** (fall then rise): Standard arc shape, most versatile
4. **Icarus** (rise then fall): Hubris arcs, false victory arcs
5. **Cinderella** (rise, fall, rise): Full transformation arcs
6. **Oedipus** (fall, rise, fall): Tragic hero arcs, ironic endings

### Hope-Despair Engine
Oscillate between hope and despair. Each cycle deepens both. After despair, hope feels miraculous. After hope, despair feels annihilating. Never let the reader settle. Small hopes in dark stories are proportionally more powerful. At climax, the reader MUST have hope, even in tragedy.

### Gut-Punch Anatomy
1. **Setup (invest)**: Build deep attachment to what will be threatened. Chapters of groundwork
2. **Context (raise stakes)**: Misdirect attention. Lighten tone. Let the character feel confident
3. **Delivery (hit)**: The blow lands. Quiet prose at impact. The more devastating, the quieter
4. **Aftermath (sit with it)**: Every prior scene looks different. Characters behave differently. Do not rush past this

### Bittersweet > Pure Triumph
Victory with cost. Personal growth from loss. Sacrifice. Mixed outcomes. The simultaneous sense of loss and hope stays with readers because the mind keeps returning, trying to resolve the contradiction. It never does.

## Subplot Management

### Thread Count
- 6-11 active threads for novel-length work
- Each subplot has its own structural arc (inciting incident through resolution)
- Offset subplot crises from main plot crisis. Resolve subplots before the main climax so they feed into it

### Rotation Priority
| Tier | Attention | Screen Time |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Primary | Main plot + protagonist arc | 40-50% |
| Secondary | 2-3 major subplots | 30-40% |
| Tertiary | Supporting threads | 10-20% |
| Background | Mentioned, not shown | Minimal |

### Convergence
Every subplot must illuminate the main theme from a different angle. Subplots that do not connect thematically are dead weight. Best subplots are not parallel but *interfering*: subplot events create complications in the main plot.

### Structural Functions
- Thematic mirror (same question, different characters)
- Thematic contrast (opposite answer to the same question)
- Character revelation (shows protagonist aspects the main plot cannot access)
- Pacing modulation (breathing room between high-intensity sequences)
- Stakes amplification (gives the protagonist something to lose beyond the main stakes)
- Complication engine (subplot obligations conflict with main plot demands)

# Battle & Action Craft Reference

Dense reference for planning, drafting, and editing battle/action chapters.

## Single Battle Arc Structure

Every battle is a three-act story with an emotional overlay.

**Act 1 (Approach)**: Lay out the plan so deviations register. Establish terrain BEFORE action using subjective landmarks, never cardinal directions. Seed complications (bad battery, shaking hands, hidden trap). Characters reveal themselves in how they handle waiting.

**Act 2 (Battle)** in three phases:
- **First Contact**: Plan works. Establish competence before destroying it. Moderate detail.
- **The Break**: One thing cascades. Detail MAXIMIZES. Time slows. Tests the protagonist's defining trait.
- **The Turn**: Character-driven, not luck. Costs something. Surprising AND inevitable.

**Act 3 (Aftermath)**: Silence after noise. Adrenaline dump (trembling, nausea, delayed pain). Cost made specific: names not numbers, personal consequences not abstractions. Who entered is not who exits.

**Emotional overlay**: Dread > Adrenaline > Confidence > Shock > Desperation > Sacrifice > Horror > Silence > Reckoning

## Power Combat (Sanderson's Laws)

Reader must understand (a) what the power does, (b) what it cannot do, (c) what it costs BEFORE the fight. The fight becomes a logic puzzle.

**Three constraint categories** (all active every fight): Limitations (what it can't do), Weaknesses (what enemies exploit), Costs (what the user pays).

**Clever use technique**: Establish rules > present a problem the power can't solve directly > let the character sit in it > solution is technically legal but creatively surprising > solution has a cost preventing reuse.

**Matchup design**: Build around asymmetric problems, not power levels. What power interaction creates the central puzzle? What limitation is tested? How does the environment change the calculus? Every location needs at least one environmental factor.

## Commander POV

### The Fog-Friction-Chance Trinity
- **Fog**: Reports arrive late, distorted, contradictory. The picture is always seconds behind reality.
- **Friction**: Equipment fails, messages garble, someone freezes, timing drifts.
- **Chance**: The enemy does something unprecedented. A civilian wanders into the kill zone.

### Information Hierarchy (most to least reliable)
1. Direct observation / power-sense (reliable for disposition, not situation)
2. Trusted subordinates' reports (filtered through their own fog)
3. Signals and indicators (gunfire patterns, emotional spikes from a direction)
4. Absence of information (silence from a team that should be reporting: the most terrifying signal)

Layer these and make them CONFLICT. Radio says "all clear" but power-sense reads terror.

**Making command exciting**: Information drip (each fragment reframes the picture). Decision trees (every choice closes options, opens others). The mask (calm on radio, terrified internally). Radio protocol as characterization (Kurt: clipped. Gabriel: hedging. Jack: understated). Silence as dread (worse than bad news; bad news is actionable).

## Spatial Logic

Describe spaces by moving through them, not blueprinting. Use relative positioning, simplified shapes, subjective landmarks. Reinforce through repetition from different angles.

**Spatial grammar**: Corridors (constrain movement, max vulnerability) > Arenas (multi-directional, flanking) > Chokepoints/Fatal Funnels (highest-stakes micro-decisions, natural beat boundaries). Alternate corridor/arena for pacing rhythm.

**Vertical combat**: Stairwells are fatal funnels rotated 90 degrees. Height = knowledge but costs safety. A single building hosts multiple simultaneous scenes.

**Environment degrades**: The battlefield at the end looks different from the start. Fire, collapse, flooding, shifted barricades.

## Coalition Warfare

### Three Simultaneous Conflict Levels
1. **External threat** (the reason the coalition exists: least interesting level)
2. **Inter-coalition politics** (who leads, who holds back, secret agendas: the real drama)
3. **Internal faction dynamics** (subordinates who disagree about the alliance)

### Coordination Spectrum
Integration > Coordination > Deconfliction > Parallel Operations. Most cape coalitions operate at deconfliction. Taylor pushes toward coordination. The gap between these levels IS the tension.

### The War Council Scene
The meeting IS the battle's first act. Show competing definitions of victory through what each faction volunteers for, refuses, and conditions. The map moment: whoever controls the intelligence controls the narrative. At least one faction must refuse something; that gap becomes the battle's central dramatic question.

### Coalition Breakdown (progressive, not sudden)
Warning sign > Rationalization > Confirmation > Cascade > Aftermath ambiguity.
The quiet break (someone simply stops advancing, melts away) is more devastating than dramatic betrayal.

## Violence Budget

### One Good Detail > Catalog of Injuries
One specific, concrete, slightly incongruous image per death/injury. The brain under stress latches onto small, irrelevant details. Choose the mundane thing that becomes permanently associated with violence.

### Escalation Through the Battle
Early: impacts, non-lethal. Middle: first blood, injuries. Late: deaths, horror. If you start at maximum, there's nowhere to go. Track what you've "spent" across arcs.

**Three depiction modes**: Full witness (transforms the narrator; max 1/arc). Implied/offscreen (cut to aftermath; reader imagines worse). Fragmented/dissociative (tunnel vision, auditory exclusion; most realistic for first-person).

**Aftermath gets equal weight**: Bodies don't vanish. Post-combat crash (trembling, nausea, thirst, jumpiness, inappropriate emotions). Three-stage progression: euphoria > remorse > rationalization. Death that matters: investment before loss (min 2-3 scenes), caused not random, witnessed not offscreen, one lands harder than three.

## Pacing

### Voice Compression Ladder (5 levels)
1. **Pre-combat** (composed): Full recursive sentences, parentheticals, theory, "which is to say..."
2. **Contact** (first compression): Sentences shorten. Parentheticals clipped. Theory drops away.
3. **Crisis** (second compression): Fragments. Sensory data. Verbs without subjects.
4. **Peak** (survival mode): Near-wordless. Single-word reactions. Intellect overwhelmed by body.
5. **Aftermath** (decompression): Voice returns slowly, shakier, less certain. Rebuilt but different.

### Time Dilation at Crisis
Write the slow parts fast and the fast parts slow. Three pages for a decision that takes half a second. Sensory expansion at the break point. Compression for routine action ("We cleared three rooms").

### Oscillation Rule
Never >500 words at a single register. Alternate between:
- Close-in (visceral, one character's immediate experience) and pull-back (wider view, tactical assessment)
- Action beats and internal thought
- Noise and silence, violence and quiet

### The Quiet Moment (max 1-2 per battle)
Dark humor, memory flash, physical awareness (noticing the shaking hands), human connection (a hand on a shoulder), strategic pause, or silence. Place after first major shock, before climactic push, or at moment of highest personal cost.

### Sensory Rotation During Combat
Don't default to visual. Rotate:
- **Sound**: Crack of powers, radio static, auditory exclusion (silence after gunfire)
- **Touch/proprioception**: Jar of impact, wrongness of a body part not where it should be
- **Smell**: Blood (copper), cordite, chemicals (max 1 per scene, never with metaphor)
- **Taste**: Blood from bitten cheek, bile, dryness of fear
- **Interoception**: Heartbeat in ears, stomach lurch, vibration in hands

## Battle Chapter Checklist

### Setup
- [ ] Terrain established through character perception before action starts
- [ ] Plan laid out so reader knows what SHOULD happen
- [ ] Each named character has an assigned role and one signature combat behavior
- [ ] Complications seeded (equipment, nerves, intel gaps)
- [ ] Emotional and tactical stakes clear

### Execution
- [ ] First contact: plan works briefly, establishing competence
- [ ] The break: one cascading failure, detail density maximizes
- [ ] Prose physically changes shape (compression ladder engaged)
- [ ] Sensory rotation (not just visual)
- [ ] POV limitations respected (can't see everything; fog of war as feature)
- [ ] Violence escalates through the battle (budgeted, not front-loaded)
- [ ] 1-2 quiet moments for contrast
- [ ] Character moments distributed (2-3 major beats, 3-4 minor, rest implied)

### The Turn
- [ ] Character-driven, not luck or deus ex machina
- [ ] Costs something irreplaceable
- [ ] Feels surprising AND inevitable

### Aftermath
- [ ] Silence after noise
- [ ] Cost made specific (names, personal consequences, what's lost beyond the person)
- [ ] Physiological crash rendered (not skipped)
- [ ] Character change visible
- [ ] Seeds next conflict

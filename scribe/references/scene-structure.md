# Scene & Beat Structure

How to build scenes and beats that drive story progression, plus dialogue craft.

## Scene Structure

### The Scene-Sequel Pattern (Dwight Swain)

**SCENE (Action Unit)**: Goal → Conflict → Disaster
- Goal: What the POV character wants in this scene
- Conflict: Obstacles preventing the goal
- Disaster: The scene ends badly or with a complication

**SEQUEL (Reaction Unit)**: Reaction → Dilemma → Decision
- Reaction: Emotional response to the disaster
- Dilemma: The impossible choice created
- Decision: Character chooses, setting up next scene's goal

The Decision at the end of a Sequel becomes the Goal of the next Scene.

### Opens with Friction, Closes on Hinge

**Opening**: First 2-3 lines must establish tension, conflict, or a problem.
Types of friction: unresolved conflict, new problem, uncomfortable situation, ticking clock, mystery.

**Closing**: Every scene ends on one of three hinges:
1. A Decision: character commits to action
2. A Reversal: situation flips
3. A Striking Image: visual that resonates

Never end on resolution. End on the moment of change, not after it.

### The Scene's Single Question
Every scene poses ONE dramatic question ("Will they survive?", "Will she convince them?").
End by answering it, usually with "No" or "Yes, but..."

### Pacing: The 300-Word Rule
At least one decision or reversal every ~300 words.
If 500+ words pass without change, the scene is dragging.

### Scene Length Guidelines
| Type | Words | Character |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Action | 800-1500 | Fast, short sentences, high density |
| Dialogue | 1000-2000 | Medium pace, intercutting beats |
| Reflection | 500-1000 | Slower, longer sentences |
| Transition | 200-500 | Brief, functional |

Vary scene lengths within a chapter.

## Beat Structure

### What Is a Beat?
The smallest unit of story change. A single shift in:
- **Status** (power dynamics, relationships)
- **Knowledge** (character learns something)
- **Plan** (character decides something)
If nothing changes, it's not a beat. It's filler.

### The "Yes, But / No, And" Engine
- **Yes, But...**: Achieves goal, but new complication arises (partial victory + raised stakes)
- **No, And...**: Fails, and things get worse (cascading failure + urgency)
- **Yes!**: Clean victory (use sparingly, for arc ends or setup for bigger failure)
- **No.**: Flat failure (add "And..." to make failure productive)

### Beat Types
Mix within scenes: Action, Decision, Revelation, Reversal, Emotional.
Action-action-action exhausts. Decision-revelation-action creates rhythm.

### Beat Causality: Therefore/But, Not And-Then
Wrong: "They did X. And then Y happened. And then Z."
Right: "They did X, THEREFORE Y happened. BUT Z complicated things."
Test: Insert "therefore" or "but" between beats. If only "and then" works, revise.

### The Try-Fail Cycle
Attempt 1: Simple approach → fails (No, And...)
Attempt 2: Adjusted approach → partial success (Yes, But...)
Attempt 3: Desperate/creative → major turn (decisive Yes! or No, And...)
Each attempt must be meaningfully different. Each failure teaches something.

### Writing Individual Beats
Each beat should specify:
1. What happens (concrete action, dialogue, or revelation)
2. What turns (what changes as a result)
3. Approximate length (how much space it deserves)

## Motivation-Reaction Units (MRUs)

Motivation (external, objective) → Reaction (internal, subjective)
Motivation ALWAYS comes first. Wrong: "I ducked. The bullet flew past." Right: "The bullet flew past. I ducked."

Reaction sequence (when showing multiple):
1. Feeling (involuntary emotional/physical)
2. Action (reflex or deliberate physical)
3. Speech (verbal response)

## Dialogue Craft

### Subtext: The Cardinal Rule
Characters rarely say exactly what they mean.
Three layers: Text (words spoken), Subtext (what they mean), Context (what reader understands).

### Techniques for Subtext
- Contradiction between words and actions ("I'm fine." She slammed the cabinet.)
- Deflection and topic changes
- Answering a different question
- Overly formal speech as distance
- The unsaid reply (silence speaks)
- Over-explanation signals lies or discomfort

### Power Dynamics in Dialogue
- Who speaks first? (Less power often initiates)
- Who controls the topic? (Power = redirection ability)
- How do they address each other? (Names, titles, nicknames)
- Who interrupts? (Power move)

### Tags and Beats
Use "said"/"asked" for 90% of tags. Cut tags when speaker is clear.
Action beats > adverbs. "I don't care." She stabbed at her salad.
Beat placement: before (setup), after (dimension), interrupting (tension/pause).

### Every Line Must Work
Each dialogue line should: reveal character, advance plot, create/release tension,
provide information, or establish relationship. If none, cut it.

### Distinctive Voices
Differentiate through: vocabulary, sentence structure, rhythm, verbal tics,
topics they gravitate toward or avoid.
The Radio Test: Cover tags. Can you tell who's speaking?

## Scene Failure Modes

Five common scene failures and their fixes:

| Failure | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Tourist scene** | Characters observe but don't act. Nothing changes. | Add a goal and obstacle. Force a decision by scene's end |
| **Tea party scene** | Characters discuss but don't disagree. No conflict. | Give each character a different want. Someone must lose |
| **Lecture scene** | One character explains while others listen. Exposition dump. | Break info across multiple scenes. Make listeners challenge the speaker |
| **Yo-yo scene** | Scene oscillates without progressing: up/down/up/down. | Each swing must ratchet higher. Never return to the same baseline |
| **Postcard scene** | Beautiful setting description, no dramatic function. | The setting must create or intensify the conflict, not decorate it |

## Expanded MRU Ordering

When showing full reaction chains, the order is strict:

1. **Feeling** (involuntary: gut clench, heart rate, flinch)
2. **Reflex** (immediate physical: dodge, grab, freeze)
3. **Rational action** (deliberate: reach for weapon, step back, assess)
4. **Speech** (verbal response: always comes last)

Skip steps freely (not every beat needs all four), but never reorder them. A character who speaks before flinching breaks immersion.

## Emotional Beat Design

Three types of emotional beats, each requiring different craft:

| Type | Definition | Technique |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Earned** | Emotion built through prior scenes, paid off here | Setup/payoff. The reader feels it because they've invested. Quiet prose at the climax |
| **Triggered** | Emotion from sudden reversal or revelation | Sharp contrast. The moment before should be calm or routine. Brevity at the strike point |
| **Ambient** | Underlying mood sustained across a scene | Sensory palette, sentence rhythm, word choice. Never stated directly. The reader absorbs it |

**Distribution target**: Mostly earned (60%+), some triggered (25%), ambient as seasoning (15%). Too many triggered beats = melodrama. Too much ambient = nothing happens.

## Psychic Distance Shifts Within Scenes

Plan distance shifts deliberately:

- **Opening**: Level 2-3 (orient the reader, establish the situation)
- **Rising action**: Level 3-4 (draw closer as stakes increase)
- **Crisis/climax**: Level 4-5 (maximum intimacy at the breaking point)
- **Resolution**: Pull back to Level 2-3 (give the reader breathing room)

**The Emotional Zoom**: When a revelation hits, shift from Level 2 to Level 5 in a single paragraph break. The sudden intimacy mirrors the character's shock.

**The Cool Pullback**: After intense Level 5 interiority, snap to Level 1-2 external description. The distance itself communicates numbness or dissociation.

## Scene Checklist
- [ ] Goal: Can state what POV character wants in one sentence
- [ ] Conflict: Something opposes the goal
- [ ] Disaster/Complication: Scene ends worse or more complicated
- [ ] Friction: Opens with tension in first 2-3 lines
- [ ] Hinge: Closes on decision, reversal, or striking image
- [ ] Question: One clear dramatic question
- [ ] MRU Order: Motivations precede reactions (feeling > reflex > action > speech)
- [ ] Pacing: At least one turn per ~300 words
- [ ] Beats all turn something (status/knowledge/plan)
- [ ] Causality: "therefore/but" connections between beats
- [ ] Failure modes: Not a tourist, tea party, lecture, yo-yo, or postcard scene
- [ ] Emotional beats: Mostly earned, some triggered, ambient as seasoning
- [ ] Distance shifts: Psychic distance varies through the scene

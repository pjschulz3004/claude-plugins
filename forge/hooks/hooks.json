If it does NOT exist AND the directory has fewer than 10 files total (excluding .git), this appears to be a new or early-stage project. In that case, include a brief one-line mention at the end of your greeting: 'Tip: Run /forge to start the guided development pipeline.' Do NOT mention forge if the project already has forge.local.md or has many files."
